# Post-Condition Analysis - abort_by_post_condition Error

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The `abort_by_post_condition` error is occurring because:

1. **Contract Logic Succeeds**: `resultRepr: '(ok true)'` shows the contract executed successfully
2. **Post-Conditions Fail**: The wallet's automatic post-conditions are failing
3. **Multiple STX Transfers**: The contract does multiple STX transfers in sequence

## 📋 **Contract Transfer Sequence**

The `buy-keys` function in `KeyVendingMachine.clar` does:

1. **Transfer 1**: `(stx-transfer? total-price tx-sender (as-contract tx-sender))`
   - User → Contract (total price)

2. **Transfer 2**: `(stx-transfer? protocol-fee tx-sender (var-get protocol-treasury))`
   - User → Protocol Treasury (protocol fee)

3. **Transfer 3**: `(stx-transfer? creator-fee tx-sender (var-get creator-address))`
   - User → Creator (creator fee)

## 🚨 **The Problem**

The Leather wallet's automatic post-conditions likely expect:
- A single STX transfer from user to contract
- Simple balance changes

But the contract does:
- Multiple STX transfers from user to different addresses
- Complex fee distribution logic

## 💡 **Potential Solutions**

### Option 1: Modify Contract Logic
Simplify the contract to do a single STX transfer, then handle fee distribution internally.

### Option 2: Use Custom Post-Conditions
Set explicit post-conditions that account for the multiple transfers.

### Option 3: Use Different Wallet
Try using a different wallet that doesn't set automatic post-conditions.

### Option 4: Contract Restructure
Restructure the contract to avoid multiple STX transfers from the user.

## 🔧 **Immediate Fix Attempts**

1. ✅ **Disabled post-conditions** - Didn't work
2. ✅ **Set postConditions: []** - Didn't work  
3. ✅ **Set postConditions: undefined** - Didn't work
4. ✅ **Removed postConditions property** - Didn't work

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

The issue is likely in the contract's transfer logic. The wallet's post-conditions can't handle the multiple STX transfers from the user to different addresses.

**Recommended Solution**: Modify the contract to do a single STX transfer from the user, then handle all fee distribution internally using the contract's balance.
