# Contract Transfer Fix - Post-Condition Error Resolution

## 🔍 **Root Cause Identified**

The `abort_by_post_condition` error was caused by the contract doing **multiple STX transfers from the user** instead of a single transfer:

### **Before (Problematic):**
```clarity
;; Transfer STX from buyer to contract
(try! (stx-transfer? total-price tx-sender (as-contract tx-sender)))

;; Distribute fees from contract balance (as the contract)
(try! (as-contract (stx-transfer? protocol-fee tx-sender (var-get protocol-treasury))))
(try! (as-contract (stx-transfer? creator-fee tx-sender (var-get creator-address))))
```

**Problem**: Lines 2-3 were transferring from `tx-sender` (user) instead of from the contract, causing the user to do 3 separate STX transfers.

### **After (Fixed):**
```clarity
;; Transfer STX from buyer to contract
(try! (stx-transfer? total-price tx-sender (as-contract tx-sender)))

;; Distribute fees from contract balance (as the contract)
(try! (as-contract (stx-transfer? protocol-fee (as-contract tx-sender) (var-get protocol-treasury))))
(try! (as-contract (stx-transfer? creator-fee (as-contract tx-sender) (var-get creator-address))))
```

**Solution**: Lines 2-3 now transfer from `(as-contract tx-sender)` (contract) instead of `tx-sender` (user).

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### **1. Contract Fix**
- **File**: `contract/contracts/KeyVendingMachine.clar`
- **Change**: Fixed fee distribution to transfer from contract balance instead of user balance
- **Version**: Updated to `KeyVendingMachine_v11`

### **2. Configuration Update**
- **File**: `contract/Clarinet.toml`
- **Change**: Updated contract name to `KeyVendingMachine_v11`

### **3. Frontend Update**
- **File**: `hooks/stacks.ts`
- **Change**: Updated `VENDING_NAME` to use `KeyVendingMachine_v11`

## 🎯 **Why This Fixes the Issue**

1. **Single User Transfer**: Now the user only does 1 STX transfer (to the contract)
2. **Contract Handles Distribution**: The contract handles all fee distribution internally
3. **Wallet Post-Conditions**: The wallet's automatic post-conditions can handle a single transfer
4. **Simplified Transaction**: The transaction is now simpler and more predictable

## 🚀 **Expected Result**

- ✅ **No more `abort_by_post_condition` error**
- ✅ **Key purchase should work successfully**
- ✅ **Single STX transfer from user to contract**
- ✅ **Contract handles all fee distribution internally**

## 📋 **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy v11 contract** to testnet
2. **Test key purchase** - should work without post-condition errors
3. **Verify fee distribution** - ensure protocol and creator fees are still distributed correctly

The fix addresses the root cause by ensuring the user only does one STX transfer, while the contract handles all internal fee distribution! 🎉
